Overview
==========

This program walks the user through the traditional Monty Hall game or performs a simulator of the game.
If not arguments are typed into the command line, the game asks the user
to pick a door he or she thinks there is a car behind. Subsequently, they are told one of the doors
that has a goat behind it. This leaves the user with two doors that can contain either a goat or
a car. Finally, the user is asked if they would like to switch doors. After responding, the user
will find out if they have won a BRAND NEW CAR!
If the user types an number of times to run the simulation on the command prompt line, the program
will print the percentage of times the computer won a car if it swapped or stayed with its original
choice. 

Usage
=======

Compile with: 'javac MontyHall.java'
Run interactive mode with: 'java MontyHall'
Run simulator mode with: 'java MontyHall {number of times}
