Overview
==========

This program walks the user through the traditional Monty Hall game. The game asks the user
to pick a door he or she thinks there is a car behind. Subsequently, they are told one of the doors
that has a goat behind it. This leaves the user with two doors that can contain either a goat or
a car. Finally, the user is asked if they would like to switch doors. After responding, the user
will find out if they have won a BRAND NEW CAR!
